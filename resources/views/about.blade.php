	            <p>I graduated from Bowdoin College in 2015 with a Math and Computer Science Interdisciplinary major. See <a href="cs">some of my projects here</a>.</p>

	            <p>After graduating, I worked as a Technical Services Analyst at Epic in Madison, Wisconsin. I loved learning about the healthcare industry and its intersection with technology. I helped multiple hospitals maintain, troubleshoot and build out Epic's emergency department software. I also did some programming for an internal project.</p>

	            <p>From there (to the surpise of many coworkers), I apprenticed at Big Picture Farm, a goat dairy in Townshend, VT. I explored my love of cheesemaking (and cheese eating) and found a new love of early morning milkings.</p>

	            <p>Besides software development, some other interests include transportation logistics, food sourcing, eating brisket sandwiches and making homemade bagels. I am also determined to find the best <a href="beercheese/1">beer and cheese combinations</a>. I am planning on taking pictures soon to make it prettier.</p>

	            <p>Now that this is starting to sound like a dating website bio, I'll conclude -- please feel free to contact me if you think I can be of help to you or your business.</p>
