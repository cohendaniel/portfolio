12/4/2015,Deschutes,Black Butte Porter,"Nearly black. Creamy and strong roasted coffee flavors. Slight acidity in the body and tastes of burnt sugar as it dissipates. Has enough body to hold up to the roasted flavors, which isn't true for all porters/stouts. Still light enough to be drinkable. Solid.",Roelli Dunbarten,Blue,Creamier than the Roth Moody Blue and less pungent. Not as crumbly. Good flavors. I would want this on a burger.,"This is great. They really work well together. The cheese removes that slight acidity from the beer, leaving just some of the maltier flavors on the back of the tongue. The beer becomes slightly sweeter like a kiss from a rose a la Seal."

Solid.",Soiree,Manchego (6 months),Subtle grassier flavors and a slight piquancy. Not very strong (hoping for more pizzazz) but good semi-firm texture.,The beer mostly overpowers this one. Less of a soiree and more of a depressing New Year's Eve party.

Described as ""earthy"" on packaging. I'm not convinced.",Same as the Soiree Manchego. A sad sheep doused in coffee.
42343,Coronado Brewing Co.,Orange Avenue Wit,"Witbier. Smells and tastes like an orange peel. It is a light and zesty beer with a slight spiced flavor throughout. There is an unappealing tang at the end. Drinkable, good, not super exciting.",Roelli Dunbarten,Blue,Creamier than the Roth Moody Blue and less pungent. Not as crumbly. Good flavors. I would want this on a burger.,What a surprise. The flavors really melded nicely -- the cheese took out some of that strange tang in the beer. The citrus blended harmoniously with the nutty blue cheese flavors. Maybe the cheese is just a really good beer cheese.

Not very strong (hoping for more pizzazz) but good semi-firm texture.,Like taking a walk on an early summer morning before the sun singes your skin. The cheese highlights some of the honey flavors in the beer. I would revisit this pairing.

The combination was smooth as if the fats encapsulated the beer and its tang in a fire blanket. Decent."
42344,Lakefront Brewing Co.,Fixed Gear,"Red IPA. Bland upfront and bland the rest of the way through. Smells yeasty and tastes yeasty. A little malt and pleasant fresh pine flavors at the end. Hops, not strong. Drinkable and smooth because there is nothing interesting.",Roelli Dunbarten,Blue,Creamier than the Roth Moody Blue and less pungent. Not as crumbly. Good flavors. I would want this on a burger.,"Decent, not as good as some other beers with this blue. The flavors don't meld too much and, like the beer, there is not much happening."

It basically just removes the fat (from the cheese) from the mouth without doing anything flavor-wise."
42345,New Glarus,Coffee Stout,Very dark brown. The creamiest. Nice bitterness. Surprisingly on the lighter and more drinkable side. Solid coffee stout.,Roelli Dunbarten,Blue,Creamier than the Roth Moody Blue and less pungent. Not as crumbly. Good flavors. I would want this on a burger.,Really good -- makes a sweeter iced coffee flavor and isn't as bitter at the end.
