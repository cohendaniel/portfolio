12/4/2015,Deschutes,Black Butte Porter,"Nearly black. Creamy and strong roasted coffee flavors. Slight acidity in the middle and some malty burnt sugar as the lingering effect. Has enough body to hold up to the roasted flavors, which isn't true for all porters/stouts, but still light enough to be drinkable. Quite solid.",Roelli Dunbarten,Blue,Creamier than the moody blue and less pungent. Not as crumbly. Good flavors.,"This is great. They really work well together. The cheese removes that slight acidity from the beer, leaving jut ome of the maltier flavors, especially on the back end. The flavors of the beer do change -- they become slightly sweeter as it reflects of the cheese."
